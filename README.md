### üìì Data Analytics Projects

|Project link | Tools | Notions | Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Mini SQL test](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/mini_sql_test)| PostgreSQL, Excel | Joins, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, COALESCE | This is a mini test I did for a Junior Data Analyst position I applied. Since it covers important SQL notions, I decided to include it on my portfolio |
|[COVID-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/covid_data_exploration)| PostgreSQL, Tableau, Excel | Window functions, rolling numbers, extract from date, subqueries, aggregation functions | This case study on COVID-19 was based on Alex Freberg‚Äôs Data Analyst Portfolio Project for SQL and Tableau and explores the correlation between the rise of vaccination with the number of infections and deaths by COVID-19 |
|[Bellabeat Case Study](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/bellabeat_case_study)| R Studio | Data cleaning, data validation, data transformation, data visualization, interpreting findings, sharing actionable insights | This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, that consists in a case-study to develop data-informed recommendations for a company called Bellabeat. I utilized R Studio to analyze FitBit 31-day fitness survey on 33 users. Check the project in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marianamorais/bellabeat-case-study-with-r)|
